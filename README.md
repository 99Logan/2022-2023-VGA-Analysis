# 2022-2023 VGA Analysis

The 2022-2023 Bennett Elementary School VGA Analysis is the first ever Univariate and Bivariate Analysis completed on Raw VGA data in BES history.

## What are the VGAs and SOLs?

The VGAs, or Virginia Growth Assessments, are standardized examinations designed to rate the progress of Virginian students in mathematics and reading. These examinations are administered twice a year; once in fall and winter. 

The SOLs, or Standard of Learning assessment(S), are standardized examinations administered annually to Virgninian students in the spring. The subjects for these examinations vary based on the grade of the student. The goal of the VGAs is to benchmark students to prepare them for the SOLs.

## Problem

Since the beginning of the pandemic, numerous industries worldwide have been negatively impacted. While innovative technologies, like Zoom, Microsoft 365, and Canvas have assisted in the operations of businesses and programs worldwide, there are still many deficits that need to be addressed within our systems.

One of most prominent industries that has been adversly impacted by this is the education system. Over the course of 3 years, students from grades 2-5 (US) have undergone several class modality changes, as well as the nuances of a new-age pandemic, which changed the teaching dogma and the dynamic of the classroom, forever. 

With all of these changes, how are we supposed to keep track of everything? How are we suppose to find out whether our teaching methods are effective or not? The answer is simple! We need to effectively analyze our data!
